  "victor_testimonial": "I contacted Adrian/FORN after our previous attempt to build a new website had come to a standstill. For people who aren't particularly creative, like myself, it was a pleasure to work with someone who could understand and transform one's sporadic thoughts and ideas into a website with a clear thread, beautiful features, and really good functionality. My recommendation goes not only to the quality of the final product, but equally to Adrian himself, for the really good experience from start to finish.",
  "dino_testimonial": "It was a welcome change to work with Adrian at FORN. As a marketing company, we can spot effective teamwork, and he executed flawlessly. Adrian took a professional yet laid-back approach that made it feel smooth and fruitful. The technical implementation is sound with responsive design, quick performance, and a layout that actually converts. Just the kind of partnership we value.",
  "fady_testimonial": "Adrian realized right away that our studio needed a site that reflected our artistic spirit. The end product shows off our work and perfectly embodies K-Ink's personality. It's evident that FORN is skilled at creating platforms that are aesthetically pleasing and function flawlessly. I can sense the difference - more visitors and inquiries. Excellent work!",
  "mette_testimonial": "I needed a website that didn't feel sterile or corporate, but didn't compromise coherency and aesthetic. Adrian got it right away. We had good conversations about how I wanted to come across - professional, but human. The result was exactly what I hoped for. My colleagues have commented on how authentic the site feels.",
